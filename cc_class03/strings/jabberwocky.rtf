\f0\fs18 \cf0 \cb2 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves \'a0\'a0\'a0Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, \'a0\'a0\'a0And the mome raths outgrabe. "Beware the Jabberwock, my son \'a0\'a0\'a0The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun \'a0\'a0\'a0The frumious Bandersnatch!" He took his vorpal sword in hand; \'a0\'a0\'a0Long time the manxome foe he sought\'97 So rested he by the Tumtum tree, \'a0\'a0\'a0And stood awhile in thought. And, as in uffish thought he stood, \'a0\'a0\'a0The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, \'a0\'a0\'a0And burbled as it came! One, two! One, two! And through and through \'a0\'a0\'a0The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its head \'a0\'a0\'a0He went galumphing back. "And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? \'a0\'a0\'a0Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!" \'a0\'a0\'a0He chortled in his joy. 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves \'a0\'a0\'a0Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, \'a0\'a0\'a0And the mome raths outgrabe. }
